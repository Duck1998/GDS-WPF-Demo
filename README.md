# GameData Switcher WPF Demo
## Introduction
[GameData Switcher][1] is a useful tool that helps you manage multiple GameData folders to switch between different mod sets. However the program still uses outdated WinForms which lacks flexibility and high DPI support.

I'm working to create a more powerful version of GDS. For now I'm trying to recreate GDS's UI with WPF, therefore it is possible to resize program window without problem and high DPI support is great.

Currently this project is only a UI Demo with ~~**NO**~~ **VERY LIMITED** functions.

## Software requirement
.NET Framework 4.6.1, already included in Windows 10 v1511 or later.  
Manual installation requires Windows 7 SP1 or later.

It's ok but why you want to resize it?
